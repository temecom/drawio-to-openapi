# vscode-uml-tools README

A collection of utilities to import models from UML design tools into a common JSON form in VSCode and then generate code for various target languages and frameworks. The use of Handlebars templating provides for extensive customization and extension to support many different output formats. Currently supported UML design tool imports are: 

* Gliffy (Confluence) documents
* drawio UML diagrams (in progress) 

## Features

* Plugable import classes
* Template driven code generation using Handlebars library
* Conversion job configuration provides batched, repeatable operations to multiple targets



## Requirements

* File exported or generated by UML design tool: 
  * Gliffy UML Class Diagram (.gliffy)
  * Drawio UML Class Diagram (.drawio)
    * See ![drawio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)


## Use
* Gliffy
    * Export class diagram as '.gliffy'
    * Open file with VSCode
* Drawio
    * Edit and save a class diagram
* All
    * Enter the command (Ctrl+Shift+P):
`uml-tools:Convert to UML`

    * Open '.json' file resulting from above (it will automatically open after conversion step)
    * Enter command: 
`uml-tools: Generate Code`
